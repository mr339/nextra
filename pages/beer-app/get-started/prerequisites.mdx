1. **Nodejs**

Make sure to have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed & running on your machine. If you already have installed Node on your computer, you can skip this step if your existing node version is greater than equal to 16.

2. **Yarn**

Followed by yarn which is necessary to install, update or delete the needed node packages for the specific projects.

3. **React/Nextjs**

As this codebase uses the Next Js framework, proper understanding and prior knowledge of _ **React** _ basics and fundamentals are required and also NextJs' routing and server components. For better understanding of React and NextJs we suggest you to once go through official documentation of React from [ReactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) along with NextJs from [NextJS.org](https://nextjs.org/).

4. **Redux Toolkit**

As for the global state management tool we have chosen the newly introduced redux toolkit which hugely decreases the boilerplate necessary to implement redux into a project. So prior knowledge of redux and its flow structure is necessary.

5. **Axios**

As for data fetching from backend we chose axios which is a package that helps you make HTTPRequests with ease. It also helps to intercept request and response and transform request and response data.For better understanding of how axios works you can go through the documentation of axios [axios-http.com/](https://axios-http.com/)
