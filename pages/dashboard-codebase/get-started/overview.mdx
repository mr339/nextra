# Getting Started

This project was created to help developers by bootstrapping basic modules that need to be present while creating a standard CMS. The main motto of this project was to save precious time while developing CMS and focus more on the core part. This project is trying to follow the best possible standard to make it optimized and production-ready. Hope you like it.
