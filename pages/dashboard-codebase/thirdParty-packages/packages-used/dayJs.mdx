[Day.js](https://day.js.org/) library is used to format dates.A single util file is present at '/shared/utils/dateAndTime-utils/dateAndTime.util.ts' for all the date manipulations.In the project it's used to export relative time.
```js
import dayjs from 'dayjs';
import relativeTime from 'dayjs/plugin/relativeTime';

export const timeFromNow = (date: string) => {
  dayjs.extend(relativeTime);
  return dayjs().to(dayjs(date));
};
```
