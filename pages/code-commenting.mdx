# Code commenting

Here are some simple rules that must be followed while writing comments on your codebase.For more detailed information, these links
can be followed :

- [JSDoc](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/jsdoc-documentation/)
- [Coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/inline-documentation-standards/javascript/#formatting-guidelines)

  Inline comments inside methods and functions should be formatted as follows:

  ## Single line comments

  They should begin with doule forward slashes

  ```js
  // Extract the array values.
  ```

  ## Multi-line comments

  ```js
  /*
   * This is a comment that is long enough to warrant being stretched over
   * the span of multiple lines. You'll notice this follows basically
   * the same format as the JSDoc wrapping and comment block style.
   */
  ```

  Important note: Multi-line comments must not begin with /\*_ (double asterisk). Use /_ (single asterisk) instead.

  ## Documentation comment

  These types of comments are signified by using double asterisk after single forward slash i.e /\*\* .The double asterisk is used to
  indicate that the comment contains special information, such as the types of parameters and return values of a function.

  ```js
  /**
   * This is a documentation comment
   *
   * This function takes in two parameters, a number and a callback function
   * The function will square the number, and then pass the result to the callback
   *
   * @param {number} num - The number to be squared
   * @param {function} callback - The function to be called with the squared result
   * @returns {number} - The result of the square operation
   */
  function squareAndCall(num, callback) {
    const squaredNum = num * num;
    callback(squaredNum);
    return squaredNum;
  }
  ```

  ## Aligning comments

  Related comments should be spaced so that they align to make them more easily readable.

  ```js
  /**
   * @param {very_long_type} name           Description.
   * @param {type}           very_long_name Description.
   */
  ```
