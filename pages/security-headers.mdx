# Security headers
 
All the security header options are set in 'next.config.js' file. The one's being used currently are: 

### X-Frame-Options
   This header indicates whether the site should be allowed to be displayed within an iframe. This can prevent against clickjacking      
   attacks.

### X-Content-Type-Options
   This header prevents the browser from attempting to guess the type of content if the Content-Type header is not explicitly set. This 
   can prevent XSS exploits for websites that allow users to upload and share files.The only valid value for this header is nosniff.

### Referrer-Policy
   This header controls how much information the browser includes when navigating from the current website (origin) to another. You can 
   read about the different options [here](https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/). The options currently being 
   used is 'strict-origin'.

### Permissions-Policy
   This header allows you to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.For example, if your CMS web app does not need to 
   access the camera or microphone of the device, you can set the camera and microphone permissions to none. If your CMS web app requires 
   access to certain sensors or media content, you can set the corresponding permissions to self.

### Content-Security-Policy
   This header helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks. Content Security Policy (CSP) can 
   specify allowed origins for content including scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, objects, media (audio, video), iframes, and more.

You can read about the many different CSP options [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).
